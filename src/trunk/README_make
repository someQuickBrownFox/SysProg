# We build all the aio stuff as a static lib (libaio.a).
# Thus, it should be easy to use it from a number of
# independent test programs.
#
# usage:
#       make
#               builds the lib (libaio.a) only
#		(Is a "make debug", actually...)
#       make all 
#               build the lib and all test programs
#               if they have been added below
#       make clean
#               cleans up lib and all test programs
#               if they have been added below
#
# Additionally, there is a sample sub directory how
# to set up a test program that makes use of the
# libaio.a
# And, there is a Makefile as well :)
