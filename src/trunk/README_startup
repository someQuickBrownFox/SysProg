After compiling via executing the `make` utility make sure to add the directory containing the aiosrv executable to your PATH environment variable.
You can do this by changing the current working directory to the directory containing the source files, and executing the following command:
    $ export PATH=$PWD:$PATH
After that, you can `cd` to the testprog-sample sub-directory and execute the test programs.
